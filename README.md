Canon2Syphon
============

Uses ofxSyphon and ofxEDSDK to allow you to bring your Canon DSLR video feed into Syphon enabled video apps

Built in openFrameworks 0.8.0

HOW TO GET THE CANON SDK:
You will have to obtain your own copy of the Canon EDSDK from their developer site to get this to load-
Getting access to the SDK is a confusing and unfortunate process :( - takes a while to find the proper link 

You can get an application to obtain the SDK at the bottom of this page (SDK request form): http://usa.canon.com/cusa/consumer/standard_display/sdk_homepage?RID=1-C729MP&CON=1-3VK3-1430&PRO=&CID=1-C1JPD1

Or alternatively - the form itself (I assume this moves around) - http://usa.canon.com/cusa/support/professional/professional_cameras/eos_digital_slr_cameras/eos_7d/standard_display/SDK

They will send you an email with a link and a login/password to download the SDK

Those login and passwords expire fairly quickly, so you will likely need to repeat this process for each new SDK release - fun!

This currently works with EDSDK 2.12 (Sept. 2013) and has worked in the past with EDSDK 2.10
