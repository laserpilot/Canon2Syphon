Canon2Syphon
============

Uses ofxSyphon and ofxEDSDK to allow you to bring your Canon DSLR video feed into Syphon enabled video apps

Built in openFrameworks 0.8.0

You will have to obtain your own copy of the Canon EDSDK from their developer site to get this to load-
Getting access to the SDK is a confusing and unfortunate process :( - takes a while to find the proper link 

You can get an application to obtain the SDK at the bottom of this page (SDK request form): http://usa.canon.com/cusa/consumer/standard_display/sdk_homepage?RID=1-C729MP&CON=1-3VK3-1430&PRO=&CID=1-C1JPD1

They will send you an email with a link and a login/password to download the SDK

Those login and passwords expire fairly quickly, so you will likely need to repeat this process for each new SDK

This currently works with EDSDK 2.12 (Sept. 2013) and has worked in the past with EDSDK 2.10
